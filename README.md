        Start from the main development branch (e.g., git checkout develop).
        Create a new branch for your feature: git checkout -b feat/new-feature. The feat/ prefix helps organize branches related to features. 
    2. Develop and commit changes:
        Make your changes, committing them to the feat/new-feature branch as you go.
        Regularly push your local branch to the remote repository to back up your work and enable collaboration: git push origin feat/new-feature.
